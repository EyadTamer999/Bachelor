\subsection{Aim}
The paper proposes an affordable and sustainable approach to personalizing learning materials. The authors developed a tool integrated into an existing learning management system.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generative AI and Personalized Learning: Accessible generative AI for implementing personalized learning in educational environments.
    \item Tool Development: A tool integrated into an LMS that generates learning materials based on learning outcomes.
    \item Multiple Learning Styles: Learning materials offered in three formatsâ€”traditional, pop-culture (inspired by Batman and Wednesday Addams).
    \item Assessment: Multiple-choice questions to help students assess their learning progress.
    \item Experiment: Preliminary experiment with 20 software engineering students, measuring engagement and perceptions through questionnaires.
    \item Study Findings: Students found the personalized learning materials engaging; quiz-style tests increased study time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gaps Addressed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scarcity of empirical studies integrating large language models (LLMs) into classroom settings.
    \item Limited research on using LLMs for lesson creation.
    \item Lack of studies bringing LLM-generated content into the classroom.
    \item Unclear reception and effectiveness of AI-generated virtual instructors.
\end{itemize}
