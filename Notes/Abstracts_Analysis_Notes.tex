\section{Use of Gamification and Game-Based Learning in Educating Generation Alpha: A Systematic Literature Review}

\subsection{Aim}
The study aims to explore the current state of gamification and game-based learning adoption for primary education students, using recent peer-reviewed research. Through a systematic mapping design, the reviewed papers are categorized and analyzed based on attributes like the type of gamification, game mechanics, elements used, evaluation context, experimental outcomes, academic subjects, and types of applications involved.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
- Type of gamification and game mechanics used.
- Educational context and subjects involved.
- Experimental outcomes and effectiveness.

\section{VoRtex Metaverse Platform for Gamified Collaborative Learning}

\subsection{Aim}
This paper introduces a new platform called VoRtex, designed to offer assistive tools for creating educational experiences in virtual worlds, particularly addressing challenges posed by pandemic situations. The authors developed a high-level software architecture for VoRtex, aimed at supporting collaborative learning activities within a virtual environment.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
- Software architecture and tools for the VoRtex platform.
- Collaborative learning within a virtual environment.
- Educational experiences designed for pandemic situations.

\section{Integrating Generative AI in Hackathons: Opportunities, Challenges, and Educational Implications}

\subsection{Aim}
This study explores the impact of generative AI on students' technological choices, focusing on a case study from the University of Iowa's 2023 event. It examines AI's role in hackathons and its educational implications, providing insights into how generative AI influences student decisions. The study also offers a roadmap for integrating such technologies into future events, emphasizing the need to balance innovation with ethical and educational considerations.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
- Impact of generative AI on technological choices in hackathons.
- Educational implications of integrating AI in student-led events.
- Balancing innovation with ethical considerations in educational environments.

\section{Development of Gamification Model for Personalized E-Learning}

\subsection{Aim}
The aim of this study is to design, implement, and evaluate a personality-based gamification model for e-learning systems, with the goal of enhancing personalization in e-learning environments. The model tailors gamification elements to learners' motivational tendencies based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The study evaluates the model's performance by assessing learner engagement and educational usability.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
- Personalization in e-learning through gamification based on MBTI.
- Engagement metrics such as appeal, emotion, user-centricity, and satisfaction.
- Educational usability criteria such as clarity, error correction, and feedback.
