1) Use of gamification and game-based learning in educating Generation 
Alpha: A systematic literature review

Aim: The study aims to explore the current state of gamification and game-based learning adoption for primary education students, using recent peer-reviewed research. Through a systematic mapping design, the reviewed papers are categorized and analyzed based on attributes like the type of gamification, game mechanics, elements used, evaluation context, experimental outcomes, academic subjects, and types of applications involved.

4) DEVELOPMENT OF GAMIFICATION MODEL FOR PERSONALIZED E-LEARNING

Aim: The aim of this study is to design, implement, and evaluate a personality-based gamification model for e-learning systems, with the goal of enhancing personalization in e-learning environments. The model tailors gamification elements to learners' motivational tendencies based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The study evaluates the model's performance by assessing learner engagement (using criteria such as appeal, emotion, user-centricity, and satisfaction) and educational usability (focusing on clarity, error correction, and feedback). The results indicate that the model effectively increases learner motivation and engagement in personalized e-learning environments.
