I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Nada Sharaf for providing me with constant support and positive feedback throughout my journey. I also cannot be more thankful to Eng. Mohamed Ehab, my co-supervisor, for his technical expertise and advice. Lastly, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Ma Xiaochen from Sichuan University who has generously and selflessly helped me use and learn from his own project to use as foundation in this research.
