\section{Use of Gamification and Game-Based Learning in Educating Generation Alpha: A Systematic Literature Review}

\subsection{Aim}
The study aims to explore the current state of gamification and game-based learning adoption for primary education students, using recent peer-reviewed research. Through a systematic mapping design, the reviewed papers are categorized and analyzed based on attributes like:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Type of gamification and game mechanics.
    \item Evaluation context.
    \item Experimental outcomes.
    \item Academic subjects.
    \item Types of applications involved.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Type of gamification and game mechanics used.
    \item Focus on Generation Alpha students (primary education).
    \item Educational context and subjects involved.
    \item Experimental outcomes and effectiveness.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gap}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited to primary education students, excluding secondary and tertiary levels.
    \item Gen Alpha students get bored due to their changing interests.
\end{itemize}

\section{VoRtex Metaverse Platform for Gamified Collaborative Learning}

\subsection{Aim}
The paper introduces a platform called VoRtex, designed to offer tools for creating educational experiences in virtual worlds, especially during pandemic situations.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Software architecture and tools for the VoRtex platform.
    \item Collaborative learning within a virtual environment.
    \item Educational experiences designed for pandemic situations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Integrating Generative AI in Hackathons: Opportunities, Challenges, and Educational Implications}

\subsection{Aim}
This study explores the impact of generative AI on students' technological choices, focusing on a case study from the University of Iowa's 2023 event.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Impact of generative AI on technological choices in hackathons.
    \item Educational implications of integrating AI in student-led events.
    \item Balancing innovation with ethical considerations in educational environments.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Development of Gamification Model for Personalized E-Learning}

\subsection{Aim}
This study aims to design, implement, and evaluate a personality-based gamification model for e-learning systems, enhancing personalization in learning environments.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Personalization in e-learning through gamification based on MBTI.
    \item Engagement metrics such as appeal, emotion, user-centricity, and satisfaction.
    \item Educational usability criteria like clarity, error correction, and feedback.
\end{itemize}
