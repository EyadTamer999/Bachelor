\section{VoRtex Metaverse Platform for Gamified Collaborative Learning}

\subsection{Aim}
The paper introduces a platform called VoRtex, designed to offer tools for creating educational experiences in virtual worlds, especially during pandemic situations.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Software architecture and tools for the VoRtex platform.
    \item Collaborative learning within a virtual environment.
    \item Educational experiences designed for pandemic situations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Integrating Generative AI in Hackathons: Opportunities, Challenges, and Educational Implications}

\subsection{Aim}
This study explores the impact of generative AI on students' technological choices, focusing on a case study from the University of Iowa's 2023 event.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Impact of generative AI on technological choices in hackathons.
    \item Educational implications of integrating AI in student-led events.
    \item Balancing innovation with ethical considerations in educational environments.
\end{itemize}

\section{Development of Gamification Model for Personalized E-Learning}

\subsection{Aim}
This study aims to design, implement, and evaluate a personality-based gamification model for e-learning systems, enhancing personalization in learning environments.

\subsection{Key Focus Areas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Personalization in e-learning through gamification based on MBTI.
    \item Engagement metrics such as appeal, emotion, user-centricity, and satisfaction.
    \item Educational usability criteria like clarity, error correction, and feedback.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scribbles and brainstorming on the side}

\subsection{Questions to Explore and reflect on when reading}
\begin{itemize}
    \item learning is about trying new things and failing, so how can we gamify that?
    \item what we like about games is the sense of progression and achievement, how can we bring that to learning?
    \item games give the player room to explore and make choices which affect the outcome but also allow them to fail and try again, how can we bring that to learning?
    \item why is an app like duolingo so successful in teaching languages? what can we learn from that?
    \item no one one's to actually fail, so how can we make failing fun?
    \item also what if we had diffuculty levels where each level is a different learning curve and each diffuculty level gives out different rewards? (we are all winners)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Game Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A game where you go up against an AI chatbot that asks you questions and you have to answer them correctly to win points, 
    in return you get to ask the chatbot questions and it will answer them for you. You can call out the chatbot if it gets a question wrong or right which will give you extra points. 
    \textbf{Problem:} How can we make this generative for the Instructor? Can we make it so that the instructor can create "Personalties" for the chatbot to have? 
    like in the paper above where they used Batman and Wednesday Addams as personalities for the learning materials.
\end{itemize}
