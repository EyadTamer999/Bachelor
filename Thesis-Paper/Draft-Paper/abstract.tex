Game design and programming are two different skills that are needed to be able to develop a game. Gamification is the processes of turning a non-gamified task into a task with game elements, and in order to achieve that the developer needs to have learned the required skills, and in the field of education gamification has proven to enhance the learning experience for the student, however the instructor would need a tool to be able to create the gamified content without the need to learn about programming or game design. The work presented introduces InstaGamae, a tool that allows the instructor to generate a game without the need of learning programming or game design and easily share the game with the students. The tool is designed to be educational and ensures gamified elements are present within the game, the game can be played through web and mobile devices to ensure maximum accessibility. The tool was tested with educators and the impressions were mainly positive towards the tool as it was seen as a tool that would ease the teaching experience and make it more engaging for the students. The work presented can improve and grow in many aspects, more quantitative testing needs to be done to ensure that the platform is useful and engaging for the students, as it was only tested on instructors.
